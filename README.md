## ðŸš§ #FixTF2 ðŸš§

*Right as I update this it immediately becomes outdated again...*
*I do suppose this is a good thing, but it's kinda surprising given Valve time.*

Valve recently released the TF2 source code for modders, which I'm definitely grateful for, in addition to the fact TF2 is nearly one year bot-free.

That being said, there are still numerous problems that remain unresolved, like ~~free-to-play accounts still being muted~~ ([sort of?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATzcWmuPfsA)) or issues with server wait times / casual matchmaking system, and it just doesn't make up for the overall lack of balance or game design effort since 2018. Sure, they did some of the right things, but I see no reason not to *keep* pushing Valve for everything we want. 

In any case, my goal is to make as faithful a recreation of TF2 as possible, while potentially avoiding some of the original's design pitfalls. I will continue this no matter the state of the source material.

## tf2
I have been working on recreating tf2 in Minecraft for the past 5 years, so I thought I would go ahead and share my work so far. Please be aware that this is insanely rough and unoptimized.

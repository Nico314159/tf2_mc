## ðŸš§ #FixTF2 ðŸš§

Valve recently released the TF2 source code for modders, which I'm definitely grateful for, in addition to the fact TF2 is nearly one year bot-free.

That being said, there are still numerous problems that remain unresolved, like free-to-play accounts still being muted or issues with server wait times, and it just doesn't make up for the overall lack of balance or game design effort since 2018. 

My goal is to make as faithful a recreation as possible, while potentially avoiding some of the original's design pitfalls. I will continue this no matter the state of the source material.

## tf2
I have been working on recreating tf2 in Minecraft for the past 5 years, so I thought I would go ahead and share my work so far. Please be aware that this is insanely rough and unoptimized.
